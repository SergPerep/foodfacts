Nutrition calculator built using Open Food Facts API.

I plan to build a one-page app that calculates nutrition values (calories, proteins, fats and carbohydrates) of the meal using Open Food Facts API.
Basic flow:
1. User searches for food items via search input
2. User adds food items to the list (the meal)
3. User specifies the amount (grams) of a food item
4. Application calculates total nutrition value of the meal

### Must have
- Search available food items
- Add food item to the meal list
- Specify the amount of a chosen food item
- Delete food item from the meal list
- Calculate the nutrition value of the whole meal

### Nice to have
- Edit food item in the meal list (change the amount of food item)
- Add different meals: breakfast, lunch, dinner
- Save data to the local storage
Regarding design I'm going to rely on material design guidelines and use colors of HYF Design Guidelines.
